# balena-airconnect
Dockerized version of [AirConnect](https://github.com/philippe44/AirConnect) for deployment to a Raspberry Pi via [Balena](https://www.balena.io/). Mostly creating this so I can AirPlay to my Sonos speakers without blowing $200 on the new speaker with AirPlay built in ðŸ˜€.

# Usage

Essentially, just clone this repo, set up a Balena project, add your Balena master, then `git push balena master`.
